This software is currently developed and tested with django version 1.10

It depends on several third party extensions that have to be installed on the system:
+ django-registration version >=2.2 [used with model based workflow]
+ django-crispy-forms version >=1.6.1
+ python-rtkit version >=0.7.0
+ python-lxml
+ requests >= 2.12
+ python-pil (for image fields)
+ django-recaptcha >= 1.2.0


The system is currently used with mod_wsgi in an apache environment. However, it is also
possible to use fastcgi. An example of a working apache config for mod_wsgi looks like:

	Alias /static/ 	/var/www/sabot/django/static/
	Alias /media	/var/www/sabot/django/media

	<Directory /var/www/sabot/django/static>
		Order deny,allow
		Allow from all
	</Directory>
	<Directory /var/www/sabot/django/media>
		Order deny,allow
		Allow from all
	</Directory>

	WSGIDaemonProcess sabot user=sabot group=sabot python-path=/var/www/sabot/django processes=2 threads=15 display-name=%{GROUP}
	WSGIProcessGroup sabot

	WSGIScriptAlias /	/var/www/sabot/django/sabot/wsgi.py

	<Directory /var/www/sabot/django/sabot>
		<Files wsgi.py>
			Order allow,deny
			allow from all
		</Files>
	</Directory>

In order to test the software, you may simply (as usual for django projects)
use "./manage.py runserver"

Before you start
- create the config files sabot/settings.py sabot/conferenceSettings.py sabot/localSettings.py (and sabot/prodSettings.py if you want to distinguish a development and a production version) from their example files (prodSettings.py needs the same parameters)
- run the project use "./manage.py migrate --run-syncdb" to setup your database and create an admin user

If you want to use the invoice creation functionality, it is required that
you have libreoffice (or openoffice) installed on the server.
